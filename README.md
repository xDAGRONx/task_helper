# TaskHelper

Offers a clean Ruby interface for interacting with
the MyTaskHelper.com API.

Includes wrapper classes for Database, Form, Field, and Record.
These classes offer shorthand methods for common API calls, as
well as convenient methods to read the data returned from the API.

Also includes an `API` module, which can be used to directly access
any available route in the API.
